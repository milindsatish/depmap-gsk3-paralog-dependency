# depmap-gsk3-paralog-dependency
DepMap-based analysis of GSK3A and GSK3B paralog dependencies across cancer cell lines. Integrates CRISPR gene effect data with transcriptomic profiles to identify context-specific, paralog-selective dependencies and associated biological programs relevant to target prioritization.
